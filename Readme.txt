The python script genRandomImage.py generates simulated micrographs which requires an image file water_amplitude_rotavg.mrc.
This file is too big to upload to github. Please use following command to generate it:
cat waa wab wac > water_amplitude_rotavg.mrc

The python script CompareDataStars_data.py compares two data.star files.
The metadata.py is the python module file used by CompareDataStars_data.py.

Please change the first line of these python script to your EMAN2 python before using.
